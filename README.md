# Tell Don't Ask Kata

This is a solution to a .NET version of the Tell Don't Ask kata by 
[Gabriele Tondi](https://github.com/gabrieletondi/tell-dont-ask-kata).

I've included some annotations in the code to explain some of the things I did or didn't do.

I haven't done any refactoring of the tests yet, which is something I may come back to as they
could use some tidying up.
